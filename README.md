=====

This project is a mix between a comunity marketplace and bounty platform. 3D Printing technologies are evolving fast, and becoming ever more common. This dApp will enable anyone to start a project with as little as a text description of the 3D artifact they want to develop. Designers can bid in a project and produce the artifact design/schematics. Manufacturers (anyone with a 3D printer that meets the requirements of a project) can bid to provide and ship the physical artifact.


## User Stories

A user opens the web app. He starts a new project by adding a text description and some pictures of the artifact he wants to be built. As the owner of the project he can later accept a design bid, and a manufacture bid. He can rate both the designer (he has access to the source files) and the manufacturer to build reputation. His project will be available for others to use and he and the designer will receive royalties thereafter.

A user opens the web app with the goal of providing designs. He can browse the existing projects that are searching for design bids, and submit a bid to existing projects. After the bid is accepted, he creates the source files offline, and uploads them on a given time-frame.

A user opens the web app to acquire an existing artifact. He browses through the existing projects, sees the details (without accessing the source files), and requests manufacture bids.

A user opens the web app with the goal of providing manufacturing services. He can browse the existing projects that are searching for manufacture bids, and submit a bid to existing projects. Upon acceptance of the bid, he produces on a given timeframe and ships the physical artifact.
